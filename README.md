## About This Repository

The goal of this project is to:

- Strengthen my understanding of machine learning fundamentals
- Practice data preprocessing techniques
- Implement classification models
- Evaluate and interpret model performance
- Build a structured ML portfolio

Each notebook represents a specific step in the learning process.
